By default, Fortify on Demand security assessments are manually audited to remove false positives. Express Audit mode will instead perform false positive removal automatically based on Fortify's Scan Analytics technology so the results will be available sooner. 
<br><br>This is a Fortify on Demand <b>Beta feature</b> and must be enabled by your Fortify on Demand Technical Account Manager before you can use it.
