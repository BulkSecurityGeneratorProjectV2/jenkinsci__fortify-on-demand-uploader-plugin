By default, Fortify on Demand security assessments are manually audited to remove false positives. 
Automated Audit will instead perform false positive removal via Fortify's Scan Analytics technology so the results will be available sooner.

This Fortify on Demand feature must be enabled on your tenant. Contact your Fortify on Demand Technical Account Manager before you use it.
